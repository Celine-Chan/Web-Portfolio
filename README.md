## Portfolio / Resume website

Hello ! I am Jean-Baptiste Theroulde !
I signed up for a retraining program in programming (mainly in Flask/Python)
nearly two years ago. Today I am looking for a one year or two years 
apprenticeship contract.
Here is my portfolio / resume website. Please feel free top contact me if you
are interested and/or if you have any questions.

NB: English and Japanese versions are coming soon...

Best regards
